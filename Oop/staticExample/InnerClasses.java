# Think of Java Classes like Toy Boxes:
A class in Java is like a toy box.

Inside a toy box, you can keep toys (objects), or even smaller boxes (inner classes).

# Outer Class vs Inner Class:
1. Outer Class (Big Toy Box)
This is the main box. Like public class InnerClasses { ... }

It‚Äôs the main thing, so Java says: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to put static on it.‚Äù

2. Inner Class (Small Toy Box Inside)
This is a class inside another class.

It depends on the outer box. It's like a toy that can‚Äôt be used unless the big box is open first.

‚ö° Now What Does static Do?
If you say a class is static, you're saying:
"This small toy box doesn't need the big toy box to exist. It can be used on its own."

Example:
A non-static inner class needs the outer class:

You can only play with this toy if the main box is open.

A static inner class can be used by itself:

You can play with this toy without opening the main box. It's like it‚Äôs stored somewhere else.

ü§Ø So Why Can't an Outer Class Be static?
Because it already stands alone, like a big box on its own shelf. Java says:

"Why would you mark it static? It‚Äôs already independent!"
